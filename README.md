# lean-protocol-support
This repo contains various modules for lean.

The primary purpose is to help reason about network protocols, including communication between systems,
serializing and deserializing messages, and some core cryptographic concepts.

Once Lean's standard library has matured, and our own contributions are more mature, we may migrate
code out of this into dedicated libraries.

Galois is unable to provide support for this library.  For questions, contact Joe Hendrix <jhendrix@galois.com>.
